		    <p>				  
			   Picking the correct Bible to use can be a daunting task due to all the different translations out there.  
			   <a href="http://usccb.org/bible/approved-translations/index.cfm" target="_blank">The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops</a> 
			   have a web page to inform us Catholics which translations have been approved for use by the USCCB since 1983. If you are 
			   not Catholic, the translation you chose should be inline with what your place of worship uses.  
		    </p>
		    <p>
			   There are word-for-word, thought-for-thought, and paraphrase translations to choose from along with the grade level that 
			   they are written at.  An interesting fact is that most of the 
			   <a href="https://notjustanotherbook.com/biblecomparison.htm" target="_blank">English Bible translations</a> are written at the eighth-grade level or below.

			<h2>The Catholic Bible</h2>
			<p>
			   The Catholic Bible has seven additional books in the Old Testament when it is compared to a Protestant Bibles. 
			   The additional books in the Catholic Bible are known as Deutero-Canonicals and are mistakengly called the Apocrypha 
			   by the Protestants.  They are Tobit, Judith, 1 Maccabees, 2 Maccabees, Wisdom, Sirach (Ecclesiasticus), and Baruch.
			   The Catholic Bible also incudes additions to the books of Esther and Daniel.
			</p>
			<p>
			   The first Bible on the left is a New American Bible (NAB) and it is in the middle of the spectrum between the two
			   translation approaches.  Sometimes it is more literal and at other times it is more conversational. It is written
			   at the seventh grade level.
			</p>
			<p>
			   I will be showing the differences between the different translations by showing the same passage for each bible.

			<h2>The Douay-Rheims Bible</h2>
			<p>
			   The Douay-Rheims is a translation of the Latin Vulgate (Biblia Sacra Vulgata) Clementine Version which was 
			   translated from Greek and other languages into Latin by Saint Jerome, about 382 A.D.  The Latin Vulgate Bible
			   was declared by the Catholic Church to be the only authentic and official version, in 1546.  Bishop Richard 
			   Challoner in 1749-1752 AD took the Latin Vulgate and translated it into English.  It is written at the 13th 
			   grade level.
